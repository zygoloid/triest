You will need:

cocos2d
pyglet
ffmpeg

The first two can be installed with 'pip install' or a suitable wheel can be
dropped into deps/. For the third one, download the shared libraries from
ffmpeg.org and place the .dll / .so / .dylib files in a new lib/ subdirectory
(or install them system-wide).

Grab some suitable music and install it to data/sounds/music.ogg
