Essentials
==========

You will need:

cocos2d
pyglet

These can be installed with `pip install` or a suitable wheel can be dropped
into deps/.

Music
=====

Grab some suitable music and install it to data/sounds/music.ogg
https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/263998 is recommended :)

If you pick that music file, you will need to install pyglet support for Ogg
Vorbis. Either of these should work:

ffmpeg
pyogg

For ffmpeg, download the shared libraries from ffmpeg.org and place the .dll /
.so / .dylib files in a new lib/ subdirectory (or install them system-wide).

For pyogg, `pip install` should work.

MacOS
=====

A few issues affect use on MacOS:

- Neither ffmpeg nor pyogg seems to work for music currently.
- cocos2d has a bug on retina displays where it only renders in the bottom left
  quarter of the screen. See https://github.com/los-cocos/cocos/issues/303
- Input (keyboard and mouse) doesn't work in fullscreen mode.
